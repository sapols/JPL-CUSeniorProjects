## M.A.R.S.
The Martian Autonomous Routing System (M.A.R.S.) is a command-line utility that produces lists of coordinates describing possible routes for a rover to take from a start to a goal coordinate, navigating a provided elevation map, within the bounds of its physical capabilities.

## Sponsor
This project is sponsored by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with Marcel Llopis providing advice and oversight for the work.

## Usage

The first step after cloning this repo is to download all the maps used in M.A.R.S. to your machine:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xHH8RP3YiBOSrKbFDmddHxtVKfZrIqUE?usp=sharing

Next, place those maps inside of `src/main/resources`.

### Input

To use the program, you must provide it:
- a compatible elevation map (see below)
- specifications for a theoretical rover, including a maximum slope it can safely traverse, as well as field of view for using the limited route algorithm
- a start coordinate (in pixels or latitude/longitude) corresponding to a location on the input map
- an end coordinate (in pixels or latitude/longitude) also corresponding to the map
- a specified algorithm type to run (see below)
- a specified algorithm to run (see below)
- a specified coordinate output type (see below)
- a specified output type (see below)

### Execution

Once the program completes, the resultant path the chosen algorithm determined will be output to the terminal in a human-readable format. It can be run again to check against another algorithm or saved to a CSV.
